An R package for analyzing time series of hormone concentrations using
Bayesian deconvolution analysis. This package extends (and refactors)
the single-subject model to multiple subjects and up to two-hormones per
patient (driver and response hormones).

The package is currently in development and not yet functional, but feel
free to take a look around.

To install, use the instructions in the root of the [libpulsatile
repository](https://github.com/BayesPulse/libpulsatile)
