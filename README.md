The development repository for the C++ backend to the unified Bayesian pulsatile
hormone modeling algorithm used in the poppulsatile R package.

This library extends (and refactors) the single-subject model to multiple
subjects and up to two-hormones per patient (driver and response hormones).

The package is currently in development and not yet functional, but feel free to
take a look around.
