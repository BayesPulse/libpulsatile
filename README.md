[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

The development repository for the C++ backend to the unified Bayesian pulsatile
hormone modeling algorithm used in the poppulsatile R package.

This library extends (and refactors) the single-subject model to multiple
subjects and up to two-hormones per patient (driver and response hormones).

The package is currently in development and not yet functional, but feel free to
take a look around.

**Installation and dependencies**

This library is intended to be used from within an R package, and therefore
relies on R's RNGs and datastructures.  The list of dependencies for the
development phase is rather specific and will be reduced later.

- C++11
- clang (>= 4.0) (on Mac for OpenMP support)
  - libclang-x.x-dev (ubuntu)
  - libomp-dev (Ubuntu)
- R (>= 3.4.3)
- R packages
  - RInside (development version via GitHub)
  - Rcpp (CRAN)
  - RcppArmadillo (CRAN)

Once these dependencies are satisfied, build the executable and the test
executable with `make`.  To run the tests, run `./bin/tests` or `./bin/tests -s`
to view the detailed test results.


# Notes

When compiled outside of the R package, the library is generally dependent on RInside for
random number generators. The chains class also uses R object types and is
geared towards structuring the R return object. Gist is, use the R package and C++
only is for dev work.
