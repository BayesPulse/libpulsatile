Description:
    Tools for Bayesian analysis of hormone data where the hormones are released 
    in an intermittent (i.e. pulsatile) pattern. Implements a birth-death MCMC
    algorithm that may be used to model time series parameters from a single 
    patient or from a population of patients. Also includes tools for simulating 
    time series, analyzing MCMC performance, and describing posterior estimates.
